## 🤖 Global Rules (AI Enforcement)

To ensure we stay in line, these rules are hard-coded into our behavior:

*   `rules/coding-standards.md` - No `any`, No `console.log`.
*   `rules/git-workflow.md` - Strict betting on `feature/*` branches.
*   `rules/security-basics.md` - Zero tolerance for hardcoded secrets.
*   `rules/documentation-standards.md` - **The README must always be up-to-date.**
*   `rules/simplicity-manifesto.md` - **Reject Over-Engineering. Stay BTP Native.**
